This is known as the superfluid discount factor, and it can be changed by Osmosis governance.\n\nTherefore, for example, if you put in $100 dollars of total assets, $25 worth of OSMO will be superfluid staked. The $50 worth of ATOM will provide a safety buffer, since the whole LP is slashable. \n\n(Note: The proportion of ATOM to OSMO will change from 50/50 as OSMO and ATOM change price. The chain logic will keep track of these changes and give you credit for your OSMO accordingly.)\n\nWhen other chains start using interfluid staking, the other half of a pool will no longer provide extra collateral, so it may make sense to set the superfluid stake percentage at 90%, for example, to provide a margin of safety.\n\nSlashing is what happens when validators misbehave badly, double-signing a transaction or colluding to attack the chain. Bonded assets can be burned to raise the costs of such an attack. In the case of superfluid staking, any slashed funds will be sent to the Osmosis Community Pool. Slashing is another reason to be thoughtful about your validator selection."

This is a big no-no in crypto - any project who does this should be questioned, named & shamed.\nYour seed is the ownership of your assets. Anyone with the seed, owns your assets!\n\n❌  Block & report all direct messages! People who message you offering assistance are not your friend. They are 100% a con-artist looking to steal your crypto.\n\n❌  Do not download unverified \"wallet\" apps or extensions.\n\n❌  Don't use relatively unknown web browsers, as they might be slow to release security updates. Only Chrome is officially supported.\n\n❌  Keplr DOES NOT have a Telegram group for support! - Don't be one of the 100,000+ potential victims on the fake groups!\nOfficial support: https://help.keplr.app\n\n✅  Install Keplr wallet from the official link only: https://keplr.app\n\n✅  Always use the verified links found in this chat. Bookmark them to be safe!\n\n✅  Keep all backups OFFLINE. Write your recovery phrase on paper, and hide in a secure location. Don't tell anybody!\n\n✅  Get a hardware wallet (e.g. Ledger Nano S or X) for air-gapped security. It's suggested to order directly from the original manufacturer. You won't even need to enter your seed phrase into Keplr!\n\n✅  Before approving a wallet transaction, take a moment & check if it is what you intend to do!\n\n🏆  Common sense goes a long way, but education is key to crypto safety. \n\nℹ️  If you have any concerns, or think you may be hacked, you can start an anonymous chat with an admin:\nhttps://support.osmosis.zone \n\nYou can also open a support ticket on the official Osmosis Discord's  \"contact\" channel:\nhttps://discord.gg/2A5c9qVF"
